# MongoDB Atlas Setup Instructions

## Important Next Steps

1. **Replace the placeholder password in the .env file:**
   - Open `c:\Users\mis\Downloads\SHOPPING-ECOMMERCE\backend\.env`
   - Find the line: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://sagardhapate16_db_user:<db_password>@cluster0.ewa2x4r.mongodb.net/ecommerce?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
   - Replace `<db_password>` with your actual MongoDB database user password

2. **Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is properly configured:**
   - Make sure you have a database user named `sagardhapate16_db_user`
   - Ensure the user has read/write permissions
   - Verify that your IP address is whitelisted in the Network Access settings

3. **Restart the backend server after making changes:**
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
   - Start it again with: `npm start` from the backend directory

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to see authentication errors:

1. Double-check your database user password
2. Verify that the database user exists and has proper permissions
3. Ensure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
4. Check that you're using the correct cluster URL

## Testing the Connection

After updating the password and restarting the server, you should see a successful MongoDB connection message instead of the "bad auth" error.
